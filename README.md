## Pixel spreadsheet

Simple script to convert an RGB image to an excel spreadsheet. Idea came from a post on [think maths](http://www.think-maths.co.uk/) website: [http://www.think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet](http://www.think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet)

### How does it work?

If we zoom in on an actual pixel, we can see the 3 channels (RGB). These three channels of a pixel are ordered vertically.

<img src="imgs/actualpixels.png" width=100 height=100>

This almost looks like an excel spreadsheet with alternating RGB rows doesn't it?

So we just do the same in our excel file where a single pixel looks like this:

<img src="imgs/apixelinexcel.png" width=100>

And we just create one of these for every pixel in our image.

<img src="imgs/pixinex.png" width=200>


#### Downsampling

Images larger than 128x128 are downsampled because these excel files would be too large and would load slowly. The downsampling does keep the original width:height ratio.

### How to run

`./image2excel.py <input image>`

After running the script it will create an `output.xlsx` file which will contain the spreadsheet image.

### Example

**Input image**

<img src="imgs/lena.png" width=400>

**Output spreadsheet**

<img src="imgs/lenaexcel.JPG" width=400>

#### Project Origionaly developed by David Takacs

This was an optional project that Davaid Takacs (takacs on GitHub) completed for the course *Introduction to Python* 
at is university.

I am using this project for a demo in my IT 101 class at Green River College
